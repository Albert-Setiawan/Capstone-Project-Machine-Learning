# Capstone Project
## Machine Learning

This repository is used to review the development of the skin disease classification code that we created.

<br/>

## Main Branch
In the main branch, there are several folders, namely Albert, Charlie, and Assets Folder.
Inside the Albert Folder is the place where the code programs are uploaded, the development of the code is also there
Inside the Charlie Folder is the place where code programs are uploaded, the development of the code is also there
Assets Folder where the photos are held which will later be displayed on this page.

## Documentation
1. Open notebook file "SKUT Satisfied K-Fold.ipynb"<br/>
   This Notebook contains the implementation step of making the model <br/>
2. Run predict.py to predict image in server, pass the image url into the terminal<br/>
   This script are used to testing some image to our model <br/>
3. Image in this repo that stored in assets folder are used to do some testing to our model <br/>
4. Predictions.json is file that contains the result of predicting model from server
